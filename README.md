# Parked for iPhone

Parked for iPhone is a simple iPhone app to help you remember when and where
you parked. It was my first proper iOS project so the code is a little rough,
cleaning this up is a large part of the 1.2 release.

The app is available [on the App Store][appstore] as a free download.
